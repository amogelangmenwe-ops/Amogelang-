                                                         📁 EC2 – Elastic Compute Cloud

Brief:

Let me tell you about EC2! Amazon EC2 allows you to launch virtual servers in the cloud, giving you full control over operating systems, software, and performance settings. Through my EC2 project, I learned how to:

Launch and configure instances

Connect securely via SSH

Install and manage software

Set up security groups and key pairs

Monitor performance and manage costs

                                                            📁 S3 – Simple Storage Service

Brief:
S3 is AWS’s cloud storage service that lets you store and retrieve files from anywhere. In my S3 project, I learned how to:

Organize data using buckets

Store and manage files as objects

Control access with permissions and security rules

Use extra features like versioning, lifecycle rules, and encryption

Understand why S3 is a powerful tool for backups, hosting, and applications

                                                           📁 Relational Database Project 🗄️

Brief:
This project helped me understand how relational databases store and manage data. I explored the structure of tables, learned how to extract insights using SQL queries, and worked with functions to clean and process data efficiently. Key learning points include:

Navigating database structures

Writing queries to filter, sort, and combine information

Using functions to manipulate text and perform calculations

Strengthening query accuracy, readability, and performance
