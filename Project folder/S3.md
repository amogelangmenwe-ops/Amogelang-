📦 Amazon S3 Project
Overview

This project focuses on using Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) as a scalable and highly durable cloud storage solution. S3 is used to store and manage various types of data—such as images, documents, logs, or backups—while ensuring security, reliability, and easy accessibility.

What This Project Covers

Creating and configuring an S3 bucket

Setting up bucket policies and access control

Uploading, downloading, and organizing files

Enabling versioning to track changes

Using lifecycle rules to optimize storage costs

Optional: Configuring S3 for static website hosting

Why S3 Is Important

Amazon S3 is ideal for projects that require dependable storage without maintaining physical hardware. It integrates easily with other AWS services, scales automatically, and offers strong security features. This makes it perfect for hosting assets, backing up data, or powering applications that need fast and secure storage.

🧩 Challenges I Faced (S3)
1. Understanding Bucket Policies and Permissions

One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how S3 permissions actually work. Bucket policies, ACLs, and IAM roles can overlap, and a simple misconfiguration often resulted in “Access Denied” errors. It took time to understand how to grant access securely without exposing the bucket publicly.

2. Organizing Files and Folder Structure

Since S3 doesn’t use a traditional file system, organizing files into a clean structure was confusing at first. I had to learn that “folders” are really just prefixes, and managing them required a different mindset.

3. Configuring Static Website Hosting

Setting up an S3 bucket for website hosting brought several challenges, like enabling public access correctly, setting index/error documents, and ensuring CloudFront (if used) pointed to the right origin. Small mistakes often caused the website not to load.

4. Managing Versioning and Storage Costs

Once versioning was enabled, I noticed storage usage increased quickly. Understanding how to balance versioning with lifecycle rules to control costs took some experimentation.

5. Uploading Large Files

Uploading large files sometimes resulted in failed uploads or slow transfer speeds. Learning about multipart uploads and using the AWS CLI helped make the process more reliable.

6. Learning the Difference Between S3 Classes

Choosing between storage classes like Standard, IA, and Glacier was a bit overwhelming. Each one has different costs and retrieval speeds, so I needed time to understand which one fit my project’s needs.
