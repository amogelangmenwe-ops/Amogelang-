                             LAB 270 Selecting data from a database 

Let Me Tell You About Databases 🗄️

In this project, I got hands-on experience with relational databases and learned how data is stored, organized, and accessed. Relational databases keep information in structured tables with rows and columns, which makes it easy to retrieve meaningful data. My main goal was to get comfortable asking questions of the database and pulling insights from different sets of information.

Connecting to the Database

Before diving in, I learned how to connect to a database and navigate its environment. This step was essential to explore how the data was structured and how different tables relate to each other. It felt a bit like stepping into a digital filing system, where understanding how everything was organized made the next steps much easier.

Exploring the Structure

Understanding the database’s layout was key. I learned how to look at the tables, see what kind of information each column held, and figure out how different pieces of data were related. This helped me get a clear picture of how the database organized information and how I could approach retrieving it efficiently.

Asking Questions with SQL

Once I understood the structure, I focused on querying the data to get meaningful answers. I learned how to filter, sort, and combine information to see exactly what I needed. It was exciting to see that, with a few well-thought-out queries, I could pull complex insights and answer real questions about the data.

Strengthening Accuracy and Performance

This project also taught me the importance of being precise and thoughtful when working with a database. Clear, well-organized queries make it easier to maintain and troubleshoot systems, while good practices in design and structure ensure the database runs efficiently. Understanding these principles is essential for keeping a database scalable and reliable.

Why This Project Matters

Overall, this project gave me a solid understanding of how relational databases organize and manage data. It showed me how to navigate structures, retrieve information efficiently, and maintain performance. These skills are critical for any work that involves handling large amounts of data, building applications, or generating insights for decision-making.



This knowledge is essential for maintaining efficient, scalable database systems.

📂 Project 1.2  

                                          LAB 272  Working with functions

In this lab, I explored how functions are used inside a database to transform, calculate, and manipulate data directly within SQL queries. The goal was to understand the different types of built-in database functions and how they can help clean, format, summarize, or extract meaningful information from data stored in tables.

Throughout the lab, I practiced using a variety of SQL functions, including string functions, numeric functions, date/time functions, and aggregate functions. This helped me see how functions can make SQL queries more powerful and help solve real-world data problems.             

Understand What Database Functions Are Used For
One of the most interesting parts of the project was learning how database functions work. Functions let you process data on the fly—they can change text, perform calculations, work with dates, or summarize large sets of information. Using functions makes queries cleaner, faster, and much easier to manage. It was fascinating to see how much you can do with just the right function applied at the right time.

Use Functions to Clean and Format Text
Another key objective was learning how to manipulate text within a database. Functions can help you adjust or analyze text values in different ways. For example, you can change text to upper or lower case, remove extra spaces, extract parts of a string, or combine text from multiple fields. These techniques were incredibly useful for cleaning messy data and preparing it for reports or analysis.

>Lab 270 (Selecting Data from a Database):
The challenges about SQL syntax, errors, understanding table structures, and interpreting query results fit perfectly with selection/query work.

>Lab 272 (Working With Database Functions):
The challenges about remembering functions, handling errors, and understanding output directly apply to working with string, numeric, date, and aggregate functions.
